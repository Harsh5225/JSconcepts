# Project: JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Countdown Timer

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and creating interactive web functionalities. It includes examples of manipulating HTML elements, iterating over node lists, and dynamically updating content on a webpage.

### Key Features:
1. **Digital Clock**:
   - Updates and displays the current time dynamically every second using `setInterval`.
   - Styled for full-screen center alignment.

2. **Dynamic Style Changes**:
   - Toggles the color of elements with the `.header1` class between red and yellow every second.

3. **Node List Iteration**:
   - Examples provided for iterating over node lists using:
     - `forEach()`
     - `for...of` loop
     - Traditional `for` loop
   - Demonstrates converting a `NodeList` into an array using `Array.from()`.

4. **Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Access and manipulation of parent and child nodes using:
     - `parentElement`
     - `parentNode`
     - `childNodes`
     - `children`
     - `firstChild` vs `firstElementChild`

5. **Summer Olympics Countdown Timer**:
   - Displays the remaining time until the 2028 Summer Olympics (July 14, 2028) in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - Updates dynamically every second.

### Usage:
- Open the project in a browser to see the clock and interactive styles in action.
- Uncomment the required JavaScript code for specific features like the clock or the Olympics countdown timer.

### Notes:
- The code is well-commented to guide the reader through various functionalities and their implementation.
